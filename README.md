Final Project by Nathan Palmer

For this project, I decided to make a a restaurant reviewing tool by using a doubly linked list data structure. I wanted to use a doubly linked list because of my inexperience with this data structure and to use some of the unique features that DLL offer. I chose to use a few different functions that utilize the main features of the Doubly Linked List. I used an insert function to put a new node at the head. I used a search function for searching a review at an index with the created list. I also created a deleteNode function that allows the user to delete a review at an Index in the list. These two functions also work together to find the accurate index and delete that node. I also wrote a function to print the full list to view the reviews and their grades together. 

Doubly linked lists are unique data structures because they can access different nodes not only from the list node. Doubly linked lists can access from the list node, next node, or previous node. Doubly linked lists can do a lot more than singly linked lists and provide easier abilities for traversing the list. 

INSTRUCTIONS: 

1) To compile the code, please type g++ final.cpp

2) Then to run the code, please type ./a.out 

3) Next, please select 1) to enter a review in format (<Rating>_<Name>) for example, A_ChikFilA or F_McDonalds, please add a few options for optimal use of other menu features. 

4)Choose another menu option, in this case, we have added a few reviews,let's search for a reviews index. Please select 3). Please search for the index in the same format you reviewed with (<Rating>_<Name>). For example, search A_ChikFilA, or F_McDonalds. You will then be given the index for that review.

5)Next, you can now delete a review at index by selecting 2). For example, selecting index 1 would delete A_ChikFilA. 

6) Next you can access the full list of reviews by selecting 4). For example, selecting 4) would now show F_McDoanalds. 

7) To exit the program, please select E to exit the program. You have now completed using the restaurant reviewer program. Thank you!
